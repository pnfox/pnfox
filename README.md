### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Patrick.

I'm a data scientist / performance engineer who enjoys writing software. Specifically my areas of interest include:

* **Efficient code and systems** to process data and solve mathematical problems.
* **Computer + System Architecture** understanding how computers do computation and how this can be optimized.
* **Machine Learning** for data analysis and how it works under the hood.
* **Computer generated art** Using mathematics and code to design stuff like my profile pic.
* **Learning from others.** Feel free to message me :)
